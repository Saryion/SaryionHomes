Some crappy random Homes plugin with GUI for Minecraft. Just started getting into creating plugins, very new to the Bukkit/Spigot API. Posting on here to keep track of my projects to reflect on.

The homes won't persist over server restarts because I haven't learned about storing data in Java yet beyond collections. I'll change it when I learn how.
